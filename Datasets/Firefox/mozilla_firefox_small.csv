346820,P5,Microsummaries,,allow sites to specify minimum update frequency,A Yahoo! guy I talked to at OSCON last week asked if the microsummary service provided any mechanism for sites to limit how frequently the service downloaded pages to regenerate their summaries using generators.  Currently; we dont have such a mechanism.; ; He suggested that we implement one; so sites can defend themselves against the load from popular generators which try to refresh microsummaries too frequently.  That seems like a reasonable request; since a generator might well set its update interval setting to a very low number and then become popular; causing problems for sites that get hit with too much traffic.; ; Since the issue is the downloading of pages; which are virtually always HTML; perhaps we could define a meta tag (and HTTP response header equivalent) that specifies the minimum update interval.  The microsummary service would sniff that value after downloading a page and make sure the next update honors it; regardless of what the generator requests.; ; We would probably want the sites setting to also override the browser.microsummary.updateInterval preference (which can be set to as little as one minute) and perhaps also the hardcoded default setting (every half hour).; ; But if we ever enable users to set a specific; explicit update interval for individual bookmarks; then we might decide to prioritize that over the sites preferences.,RESOLVED,WONTFIX,Trunk,2006-08-01 02:52:20 -0700,2011-05-02 05:30:16 -0700

Now we only do it at shutdown.; ; Rationale : in 1997 I once installed a Netscape browser (version 3); that was; displaying some meeting shedule. It was for a very busy European Union; governemental conference center; but they had no budget to buy a real; announcement display (airport style); especially because none of them had a; web-interface at that time. So I hacked up something for them. 4 displays were; continuously refreshing their info every minute; but were completely; unattended. After a few weeks they got in trouble with memory leaks and such;; so I told the operators that they had to restart the browser once in a while; (and they were running Windows 95 too; which had its own problems). But they; did it with a remote reboot; which means that the browser was never shut down.; ; The memory leaks were solved; but those browsers were never shut down the; nromal way (File->Exit). Since the history-cleanup was only done during a; normal startup; this means that the history was growing forever; but never; could be cleaned. Netscape 4 fixed this I think.; ; Anyway; I worked around the problem by cleaning history during startup (the; displays were running until 2 years ago !!!); but we might be careful in the; current implementation; just in case a user never shuts down cleanly.

The Apple HIG; however; states that click-and-hold should; be an equivalent operation to click; except for in certain circumstances (such; as Dock tiles). Instead; Apples recommended route to context menus is ctrl+click.; ; Safari; Camino; Opera and IE 5 for Mac all use the standard ctrl+click to get; context menus; and do not respond to click-and-hold. The only click-and-hold; action in these browsers is on the back/forward buttons; to get the drop-down; history (see bug 102330).

Further; the current click-and-hold; implimentation is somewhat buggy.; ; Others feel that the established user base would be very upset about this; feature being removed; noting that ctrl+click is still there; and this is just a; further optimization for one-mouse-button users.

It should be  one stop shop for all accessibility questions.  Now; since keyboard bindings are documented and the section is quite large a link to the section within the accessibility help should suffice.  Some starting points can be:; ; - Link to keyboard bindings ; - Toggle Images; javascript; audio/video playback; etc; - Changing and overriding text/background colors/fonts/sizes; - Setting FIrefox to use system fonts and colors as opposed to its own or the web pages fonts and colors.; - Section on what is possible to accomplish with changing stylesheets.; - If accessibility extensions are going to be considered; provide instructions that will help the user obtain accessibility extensions. Then Provide Keyboard binding information for the extensions; - How to use the search function; for instance document that ctrl+g performs a find again; since this is not an expected keyboard shortcut.; - Section on how to configure Firefox to handle Tabbed Browsing.; - Section on enabling caret browsing; and clipboard features.; - Section documenting the profiles functionality of firefox and how to create; change; and invoke them.  As well as how accessibility features are affected; i.e. user defined style sheets; - Blocking popups; ; Separate subsections for the following may be helpful; - FireFox features for accessibility ( overall picture; keyboard access); - Customization for accessibility (color; font; toolbars if any ); - Any new features that might help accessibility  or features that work different.

777373,P1,Developer Tools: Inspector,,CssRuleView.jsm uses invalid weak map keys,Line 490 in CssRuleView.jsm uses (I think) a nsIDOMCSSStyleDeclaration as a key in the weak map |disabled| [1].  Unfortunately; this is not okay because the only C++ things we support as weak map keys are nodes (for technical reasons; we only can only support objects that support wrapper preservation; and just allowing nodes was a simple way to do that).; ; The current behavior is that the key will be successfully added (with a warning); but it can eventually get its entry in the weak map thrown out during a later GC.  In bug 761620; I am planning to make it so that unsupported keys are not added; and an exception is thrown; so it is more obvious that something has gone wrong.; ; To fix this; you either have to switch to using some other kind of key; which could be tricky.  If you can get back and forth between the style and its node maybe that would work.  Otherwise; you may need to switch to another data structure; like a map; though then you have to be more careful to avoid leaks.; ; In the longer term; in bug 753517; CSS things are going to be converted over to the new DOM bindings; which I believe means they will be wrapper cached; and thus we can loosen the restriction on weak map keys to include these CSS things.  But you probably want to fix this before that.; ; CCing Boris who understands what is going on with wrapper preservation of CSS stuff.; ; [1] http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleinspector/CssRuleView.jsm#490,RESOLVED,FIXED,Trunk,2012-07-25 09:09:08 -0700,2012-07-31 07:40:45 -0700

791019,P1,Shell Integration,,Default file type association is broken on Windows 8,Before Windows 8 RTM; we had file type associations working as of bug 764515 which is on Beta right now.  As of Windows 8 RTM; prompts that we do for file type defaults no longer set us as the default for those file types.  So right now on Beta file type associations like .html are completely broken.  Windows 8 will already be shipped once we release Beta.; ; In Windows 8 pre RTM; protocol association was protected by a cryptographic hash but not file type association.  As of RTM both file type association and protocol association are protected by a cryptographic hash.  The only way to set the default browser when there is a cryptographic hash is by asking the OS to prompt the user.; ; you can set protocol association which sets the cyrptographic hash with a little flyout window that lists all the browsers and the user just selects one.  This is what we were doing as of bug 764515; and we were setting the file type associations via helper.exe.  I should mention that you can also produce a flyout for file type association; but only for one at a time; and it doesnt include protocol defaults.; ; What IE10 does; for default browser is it shows that protocol association flyout on the startup check; but if you go to options and set the defaults that way; it launches control panel which can set both protocol + file type association at the same time.  (Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Default Programs); ; I recommend that we do the same as IE10 here; and that we also uplift it to aurora + beta so that file type defaults are not broken in win8.,VERIFIED,FIXED,Trunk,2012-09-13 10:23:39 -0700,2013-03-14 07:20:41 -0700

Were not sure of the cause; especially since this same preference works fine when running in a Firefox environment. We were able to use this before; so theres been a regression. This problem showed up sometime last week at least.; ; To reproduce; first ensure that marionette is running on your b2g device:adb forward tcp:2828 tcp:2828 and test that marionette is running with telnet localhost 2828.; ; Then add the preference to /data/local/user.js and in adb shell; run stop b2g then start b2g. Now try to telnet; and the connection wont be made.; ; Panos; do you have any hypotheses on whats going on?,RESOLVED,FIXED,13 Branch,2012-10-10 14:36:37 -0700,2012-12-21 15:18:24 -0800

Not the content of the tool (markup view and rule view in this mockup); ; About 1);; ; The toolbox toolbar should not use common.css and have its own style. common.css is a stylesheet shared by all the tools to ensure they have a shared look (button; toolbars; search fields;  ). The toolbox doesnt need it. Not using common.css will make our work easier (we can start working on 1); then work on 2)).; ; For 2);; ; This mockup uses a flat design. We need mockups for the other tools as well; because most of the work will happen on common.css and will affect all the tools. ; ; For example: in the inspector; we see that the tool toolbar doesnt have any padding anymore. That means that the buttons in the other tools (web console and debugger) wont have room around them. This wont be possible as they have borders in the current implementation.; ; We need mockups for the other tools; or a design for all the in-tools controls (textbox; searchbox; toolbarbutton; toolbarbutton with no text but only icon; dropdown menu; button + dropdown menu).; ; This also covers the sidebar.; ; For 3);; ; this can be done in parallel.

However; I found out that the multiple reflows can be easily avoided by temporarily removing the richlixtbox from the document. This isnt noticeable at at all; and at least on my machine it almost completely resolves the slowness we see on Alices profile. So; ugly as it is; I think we should go ahead and do it.; ; I also found out that un-attaching the richlistitem binding from the inactive elements has a notable positive effect. This hack I like less; because it could have some side-effects (for example; itd be a little tricky to have searchLabel working for this items). However; the gain is notable enough that its at least worth trying. We can take it back later if it turns out to be problematic.; ; Patch attached.
